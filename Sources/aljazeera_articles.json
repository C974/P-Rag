    "Content": "Khan Younis, Gaza– Yazan Musleh, 13, lies in a hospital bed set up in a tent on the grounds of Nasser Hospital, his t-shirt pulled up to reveal a large white bandage on his thin torso.\nBeside him, his father, Ihab, sits fretfully, still shaken bythe bloodied dawnhe and his sons lived through on Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on thousands of people gathered to receive aid from the Israeli-conceived, and United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nIhab, 40, had taken Yazan and his 15-year-old brother, Yazid, from their shelter in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, to the Rafah distribution point that the GHF operates.\nThey set out before dawn, walking for about an hour and a half to get to the al-Alam Roundabout in Rafah, near the distribution point.\nWorried about the size of the gathering, hungry crowd, Ihab told his sons to wait for him on an elevation near the GHF gates.\n“When I looked behind the hill, I saw several tanks not far away,” he says. “A feeling of dread came over me. What if they opened fire or something happened? I prayed for God’s protection.”\nAs the crowd moved closer to the gates, heavygunfire erupted from all directions.\n“I was terrified. I immediately looked towards my sons on the hill, and saw Yazan get shot and collapse,” he recalls.\nYazid, also sitting by his brother’s bedside, describes the moments of terror.\n“We were standing on the hill as our father told us, and suddenly, the tanks opened fire.” He says. “My brother was hit in the stomach immediately.”\n“I saw his intestines spilling out – it was horrifying. Then people helped rush him to the hospital in a donkey cart.”\nDown by the gates, Ihab was struggling to reach his sons, trying to fight against the crowd while avoiding the shots still ringing out.\n“Shooting was coming from every direction – from tanks, quadcopters.\n“I saw people helping my son, eventually dragging him away.”\nWhen Ihab managed to get away from the crowd, he ran as best as his malnourished body could manage, towards Nasser Hospital, in hopes that Yazan had been taken there. It felt like more than an hour, he says.\nAt Nasser Hospital, he learned that Yazan had been taken into surgery.\n“I finally breathed. I thanked God he was still alive. I had completely lost hope,” he says.\nThe bullet that hit Yazan had torn through his intestines and spleen, and the doctors say he needs long and intensive treatment.\nSitting by him is his mother, Iman, who asks despairingly why anyone would shoot at people trying to get food. She and Ihab have five children, the youngest is a seven-month-old girl.\n“I went to get food for my children. Hunger is killing us,” says Ihab.\n“These aid distributions are known to be degrading and humiliating – but we’re desperate. I’m desperate because my children are starving, and even then, we are shot at?”\nHe had tried to get aid once before, he says, but both times he came away empty-handed.\n“The first time, there was a deadly stampede. We barely escaped. This time, my son was wounded and again… nothing,” he says.\nBut he knows he cannot stop trying.\n“I’ll risk it for my family. Either I come back alive or I die. I’m desperate. Hunger is killing us.”\nThe GHF, marketed as a neutral humanitarian mechanism, waslaunched in early 2025and uses private US military contractors to “secure the distribution points”.\nThe GHF’s head, Jake Wood, resigned his post two days before distribution began, citing concerns that the foundation would not be impartial or act in accordance with humanitarian principles.\nFive days later, on May 30, the Boston Consulting Group, which had been part of the planning and implementation of the foundation, withdrew its team and terminated its association with GHF.\nInternational aid organisations have been unanimous in criticising the GHF and its methods.\nLying nearby in the tent ward is Mohammed al-Homs, 40, a father of five.\nHe had also headed out early on Sunday to try to get some food for his family, but moments after arriving at the al-Alam Roundabout roundabout, “I was shot twice – once in the leg and once in the mouth, shattering my front teeth,” he says.\n“I collapsed, there were so many injured and dead around me. Everyone was screaming and running. Gunfire was coming from tanks, drones everywhere. It felt like the end of the world.”\nHe lay bleeding on the ground for what felt like an hour, as medical teams were not able to reach the injured.\nThen, word spread that the gates had opened for distribution, and those who could move started heading towards the centre.\nIt was only then that people could start moving the wounded to a nearby medical point.\n“This was my first time trying to get aid, and it will be my last,” Mohammed says.\n“I didn’t expect to survive. We went looking for food for our hungry children and were met with drones and tanks.”\nAlso in the tent is someone who had succeeded in getting an aid package on the first day of distribution, on May 27, and decided to try again on Sunday: 36-year-old Khaled al-Lahham.\nAl-Lahham is taking care of 10 family members: his parents, one aunt, and seven siblings, all of whom are displaced in the tents of al-Mawasi.\nHe had managed to catch a ride with five friends that morning, driving as close as they could to the al-Alam Roundabout roundabout.\nAs the distribution time approached, the six friends started getting out of the car.\n“Suddenly, there was loud gunfire all around and people screaming. I felt a sharp pain in my leg – a bullet had passed clean through my thigh,” says Khaled, who did not make it fully out of the car.\n“I was screaming and bleeding while people around me ran and screamed. The shooting was frenzied,” he adds. “There were tanks, quadcopters – fire came from every direction.”\nInjured, Khaled could not get out of the car and huddled there until one of his friends managed to return and drive him to the hospital.\n“I never imagined I’d face death for a box of food,” Khaled says.\n“If they don’t want to distribute the aid, why do they lie to people and kill them like this?\n“This is all deliberate. Humiliate us, degrade us, then kill us – for food?”",

    "Content": "The United States- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) will suspend aid distribution in the war-torn territory on Wednesday, a day afterIsraeli forces again opened fireon Palestinian aid seekers near a GHF distribution site, killing at least 27 and injuring more than 100.\nIsrael’s military also said that approach roads to the aid distribution centres will be “considered combat zones” on Wednesday, and warned that people in Gaza should heed the GHF announcement to stay away.\n“We confirm that travel is prohibited tomorrow on roads leading to the distribution centers … and entry to the distribution centers is strictly forbidden,” an Israeli military spokesperson said.\nIn a post on social media, GHF said the temporary suspension was necessary to allow for “renovation, reorganisation and efficiency improvement work”.\n“Due to the ongoing updates, entry to the distribution centre areas is slowly prohibited! Please do not go to the site and follow general instructions. Operations will resume on Thursday. Please continue to follow updates,” the group said.\nThe temporary suspension of aid comes as more than 100 Palestinian people seeking aid have beenreported killed by Israeli forcesin the vicinity of GHF distribution centres since the organisation started operating in the enclave on May 27.\nThekilling of people desperately seeking foodsupplies has triggered mounting international outrage with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanding an independent inquiry into the deaths and for “perpetrators to be held accountable”.\n“It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food,” Guterres said.\nThe Israeli military has admitted it shot at aid seekers on Tuesday, but claimed that they opened fire when “suspects” deviated from a stipulated route as a crowd of Palestinians was making its way to the GHF distribution site in Gaza.\nIsrael’s military said it is looking into the incident and the reports of casualties.\nOn Tuesday, GHF named its new executive chairman as US evangelical Christian leader Reverend Dr Johnnie Moore.\nMoore, who was an evangelical adviser to the White House during the first term of United States President Donald Trump, said in a statement that GHF was “demonstrating that it is possible to move vast quantities of food to people who need it most — safely, efficiently, and effectively”.\nThe UN and aid agencies have refused to work with the GHF, accusing the group of lacking neutrality and of being part of Israel’s militarisation of aid in Gaza. Israel has also been accused of“weaponising” hunger in Gaza, which has been brought about by a months-long Israeli blockade on food, medicine, water and other basic essentials entering the war-torn territory.\nMoore’s appointment is likely to add to concerns regarding GHF’s operations in Gaza, given his support for the controversial proposal Trump floated in February for the US to take over Gaza, remove the Palestinian population, and focus on real estate development in the territory.\nAfter Trump proposed the idea, Moore posted video of Trump’s remarks on X and wrote: “The USA will take full responsibility for future of Gaza, giving everyone hope & a future.”\nResponding on social media to UN chief Guterres’s outrage following the killing of aid seekers in Gaza on Sunday, Moore said: “Mr Secretary-General, it was a lie… spread by terrorists & you’re still spreading it.\nThe GHF’s founding executive director, former US marine Jake Wood, resigned from his position before the Gaza operation began, questioning the organisation’s “impartiality” and “independence”.\nCritics have accused GHF, which has not revealed where its funds come from, of facilitating the Israeli military’s goal of depopulating northern Gaza as it has concentrated aid distribution in the southern part of the territory, forcing thousands of desperate people to make the perilous journey to its locations to receive assistance.",

    "Content": "Federal officials in the United States have taken into custody the family of a man suspected ofattacking a pro-Israel rallyin Boulder, Colorado, over the weekend.\nIn a video on Tuesday, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the family of Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n“This terrorist will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Noem said in the video. “We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it.”\nPolice have accused the 45-year-old Soliman of throwing Molotov cocktailsinto a crowdthat had gathered for an event organised by Run for Their Lives, a group calling for the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza.\nAccording to an affidavit, Soliman yelled “Free Palestine” while hurling the incendiary devices.\nThe firebombs injured 12 people, three of whom remain hospitalised. Police have said Soliman planned the attack for more than a year. He is facing federal hate crime charges.\n“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again,” J Bishop Grewell, Colorado’s acting US attorney, said during a news conference Monday.\nSoliman said that he acted alone and that nobody else knew of his plans. But officials with the administration of US President Donald Trump said they will investigate whether his wife and five children were aware of the suspect’s intentions.\nAdministration officials have also highlighted the fact that Soliman, an Egyptian national, was in the US on an expired tourist visa, tying his arrest — and that of his family — to a larger push against undocumented immigration.\n“The United States has zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorism,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday.\n“Under the Trump administration, aliens will only be admitted into the United States through the legal process and only if they do not bear hostile attitudes towards our citizens, our culture, our government, our institutions or, most importantly, our founding principles.”\nSoliman’s family includes a wife and five children. The official White House account on the social media platform X indicated that they “could be deported by tonight”.\n“Six One-Way Tickets for Mohamed’s Wife and Five Kids. Final Boarding Call Coming Soon,” Tuesday’s postread.\nThe attack comes amid rising tensions in the US over Israel’s continued war in Gaza, which United Nations experts and human rights groups havecompared to a genocide. It also comes less than two weeks after thefatal shootingof two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC.\nJewish as well as Muslim and Arab communities have reported sharp upticks in harassment and violence since the war began.\nTrump andhis allieshave used concerns about anti-Semitism as a pretext to push hardline policies on immigration and a crackdown on pro-Palestine activists.\n“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” Trump said in a social media post on Monday.\nBut the president and his supporters have themselves faced allegations of leaning intoanti-Semitic rhetoric. And his administration’s push to expel foreign nationals has caused alarm among civil liberties groups.\nThe administration is currently attempting to deport several international students involved in pro-Palestine activity, including a Turkish graduate student named Rumeysa Ozturk.\nHer legal team argues that Ozturk appears to have been arrested for co-signing an op-ed calling for an end to the war in Gaza. Ozturkwas releasedfrom immigrant detention in May following a legal challenge, but she continues to face deportation proceedings.",

More than 90 percent of the enclave’s 2.3 million people are facing acute food shortages, according to aid groups.\nThe Madleen, named after Gaza’sfirstand only fisherwoman, departed Catania, Sicily, on June 1, just one month after Israeli dronesbombedConscience, another FFC aid ship, off the coast of Malta.\nThe 2,000km (1,250-mile) journey is expected to take seven days, provided there are no disruptions.\nThe ship’slocationis being monitored live by Forensic Architecture and using a Garmin livetrackeron board.

    "Content": "Matthew Miller, the former spokesperson of the US State Department who spent months defending Israel’s conduct in the war in Gaza, has acknowledged that the Israeli military has “without a doubt” committed war crimes in thePalestinian territory.\nMiller told the Sky News Trump100 podcast on Monday, however, that he did not believe genocide was being carried out in Gaza.\n“I don’t think it’s a genocide, but I think it is – without a doubt – true that Israel has committed war crimes,” Miller said.\nThe ex-spokesperson served as one of the public faces of former President Joe Biden’s staunch support for Israel as it killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and flattened much of the enclave.\nUnited Nations experts and leading rights groups have accused Israel of genocidal acts – an effort to destroy the Palestinian people in full or in part.\nMiller’s comments raise questions on why the Biden administration continued to arm Israel despite US laws that restrict military aid to countries that commit violations of human rights and international law.\nThe former US president’s aidesrepeatedly certifiedthat they could not conclude that Israel was violating the laws of war or restricting humanitarian aid to Palestinians, despite the ample evidence documenting Israeli abuses.\nAccording to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 54,381 Palestinians have been killed and 124,054 wounded. Almost all of the enclave’s 2.3 million people have been displaced, while an Israeli blockade threatens famine.\nDuring his time with the State Department,Millerregularly clashed with journalistswho questioned the US response to Israel’s handling of Gaza, including bombings of medical facilities and camps sheltering Palestinian civilians.\nIn one incident last November, Miller was rebuked for laughing during a question about Israel blocking aid to Gaza. US law specifically prohibits security assistance for states that restrict US-backed humanitarian aid in conflict zones.\nWhen asked about particular atrocities, including – for example – the killing of six-year-old Palestinian girlHind Rajablast year, Miller would often say the the US officials brought up the incident with their Israeli counterparts, who are investigating.\nThe spokesperson would then keep invoking these alleged contacts and probes – sometimes months after the incident – to dismiss questions about suspected war crimes by Israel.\nOn the Sky News podcast, Miller appeared to criticise his own pattern of answering questions when he served as spokesperson. “We do know that Israel has opened investigations. But, look, we are many months into those investigations. And we’re not seeing Israeli soldiers held accountable,” he said.\nMiller stressed in the interview on Monday that, as spokesman, he was not advocating his own opinion but expressing the official stance of Biden’s administration.\n“You are a spokesperson for the president, the administration, and you espouse the positions of the administration,” he said. “And when you’re not in the administration, you can just give your own opinions.”\nAsked about his experience handling the issue,Millersaid there were “small and big” disagreements within the Biden administration over how to deal with Israel.\n“There were disagreements all along the way about how to handle policy. Some of those were big disagreements, some of those were little disagreements,” he said.\nIn particular, he hinted at tensions between Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nHe admitted that “there probably was” more that the US could have done to pressure Israel to stop the war and prevent the killing of “thousands of … innocent civilians who didn’t want this war”.\nOn Tuesday, the Palestinian group Hamas said Miller’s comments further confirm Israel’s crimes and underscores Washington’s “direct responsibility as a true partner” in the genocide against Palestinians.\n“We call on the international community and international judicial institutions to turn these dangerous confessions into investigations and immediate legal action,” Hamas said in a statement.\nRaed Jarrar, the advocacy director at DAWN, a US-based advocacy group, said it was “outrageous” that Miller waited until he was out of office to admit that Israel committed war crimes in Gaza.\n“US officials whoknow atrocitiesare being committed and continue defending them from behind the podium are not neutral, they are complicit. Miller’s silence while in government helped Israel with its genocide. He has Palestinian blood on his hands,” Jarrar told Al Jazeera in an email.\n“Anyone guilty of aiding and abetting genocide should be held accountable by the International Criminal Court or other international mechanisms.”",

    "Content": "Israeli forces have killed at least 27 Palestinians and injured 90 as they opened fire close to an aid distribution site in Rafah, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.\nThe latest killings came early on Tuesday at the Flag Roundabout near an aid hub operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in southern Gaza.\nIt was the third such incident around the Rafah hub in as many days. Gaza’s authorities reported that more than 100 aid seekers have beenkilledsince the United States- and Israel-backed GHF started operating in the enclave on May 27 as reports ofviolence, looting and chaosare rife.\nThe Israeli military said it had fired shots as “a number of suspects” deviated from the regulated routes, on which a crowd was making its way to the GHF distribution complex.\nThe “suspects” were about 500 metres (550 yards) from the site, the military said in a statement on Telegram, adding that it was looking into reports of casualties.\nThe death toll was confirmed by Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the Gaza Health Ministry’s records department.\nA spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, Hisham Mhanna, said 184 wounded people had been taken to its field hospital in Rafah, 19 of whom were dead on arrival and eight died later of their wounds.\nVideo verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency showed the arrival of dozens of injured people at the hospital.\nGaza’s Government Media Office accused Israel of “a horrific, intentionally repeated crime”, saying it has been luring starving Palestinians to the GHF centres – opened after an 11-week total Israeli blockade to take over most aid distribution from the United Nations and other aid agencies – and then opening fire.\nIt said Tuesday’s death toll brought the number of aid seekers killed at aid sites in the Rafah governorate and the Netzarim Corridor since GHF launched operations to 102 with 490 people injured.\nThe GHF later announced that its distribution centres will be closed on Wednesday, citing the need for “update, organisation and efficiency improvement work”. It said entry into those food distribution sites is prohibited and that they will reopen on Thursday.\nThe UN on Mondaydemanded an independent investigationinto the repeated shootings of aid seekers in Gaza.\n“It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. “I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable.”\n“We heard from witnesses that there was chaos,” Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said, reporting about Tuesday’s killings from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza. “The Israeli forces just opened fire randomly, shooting Palestinians, … using quadcopters and live ammunition.”\nHealth Ministry officials and doctors said most of the wounded were hit in the chest and head, she added.\nThe bloodshed, she continued, had unfolded in the same way as on the previous two days amid ongoing chaos around the aid distribution centres.\n“There’s no process. There’s no system,” she said. “You just need to run first to be able to get the food.”\nWitness Rasha al-Nahal told The Associated Press news agency that “there was gunfire from all directions” and she saw more than a dozen people dead and several wounded on the road.\nWhen she finally made it to the distribution hub, there was no aid, al-Nahal said, adding that Israeli soldiers “fired at us as we were returning”.\nAnother witness, Neima al-Aaraj, from Khan Younis described the shooting as “indiscriminate”.\n“I won’t return,” she said. “Either way, we will die.”\nThe Israeli military, in its statement on Telegram, said soldiers had fired warning shots as people were not using “designated access routes” and “after the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced toward the troops”.\nHowever, it denied firing on civilians or blocking them from accessing aid.\nThis account echoes statements about similar incidents on Sunday when 31 aid seekers were reportedly killed and on Monday when three more were killed.",

    "Content": "In its latest assault on Gaza’s decimated healthcare system,Israelhas once again targeted the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, this time with drones, as its forces are also carrying out a ground offensive in the north and south of the bombarded territory.\nHealth officials said late on Sunday that fighting around the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza and an Israeli military “siege” forced it to shut down.\nIt was the main medical facility in the north after Israeli air strikes last year also forced the Kamal Adwan and Beit Hanoon hospitals to stop providing health services.\n“There is direct targeting on the hospital including the intensive care unit,” Indonesian Hospital director Dr Marwan al-Sultan said in a statement, adding that no one could reach the facility, which had about 30 patients and 15 medical staff inside.\nIsrael has repeatedly targeted hospitals during its 19-month war on Gaza. Human rights groups and United Nations-backed experts have accused Israel of systematically destroying Gaza’s healthcare system.\nEarlier, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged enclave’s north, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the latest strikes – which have been ongoing since Saturday – indicate that Israeli attacks on Gaza’s hospitals are intensifying.\n“The medical teams are really suffering, and we have a few numbers of medical teams and staff … and a lot of people are in need [of] more medical care,” Abu Salmiya said by phone from the hospital on Sunday.\nThousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned. Blood donations are urgently needed.\nThis has been underscored by Gaza’s Health Ministry, which confirmed that Israeli forces besieged the facility in Beit Lahiya, adding that “a state of panic and confusion is prevailing”.\nThe ministry later said that Israel had cut off the arrival of patients and staff, “effectively forcing the hospital out of service”.\nWith “the shutdown of the Indonesian Hospital, all public hospitals in the North Gaza Governorate are now out of service”, it said.\nGaza’s healthcare facilitieshave been targeted repeatedly throughout Israel’s deadly assault that began 18 months ago.\nOther facilities in the north that have been bombed, burned, and besieged by the Israeli military since the start of the war include Kamal Adwan Hospital, al-Shifa Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, and al-Awda Hospital. Dozens of other medical clinics, stations, and vehicles have also come under attack.\nThe targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients is considered a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Convention.\nIsrael has also battered several hospitals in Gaza’s central and southern areas, including Deir el-Balah’s Al-Aqsa Hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.\nEarlier this week, Israelstruck two hospitals in Khan Younis. Nine missiles slammed into and around the courtyard of the European Gaza Hospital, killing at least 16 people, while an attack on the Nasser Medical Complex killed two people, including a wounded journalist.\nIncessant attacks on Gaza’s healthcare sector have left it reeling, devastating its ability to function, while doctors say they are out of medicine to treat routine conditions.\nHospitals have also been on the verge of total collapse amid a brutal and ongoing blockade, where Israel continues to bar the entry of much-needed medical supplies, fuel, and other humanitarian aid including food and clean water.\nThe crisis in Gaza has reached one of its darkest periods, humanitarian officials warn, as famine also looms.\nIsraeli air strikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the last 72 hours.\nStrikes over the weekend have also put the European Hospital, the only remaining facility providing cancer treatments in Gaza, out of service.\nAl Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said dozens of Palestinians have been wounded, and doctors say “they’re facing numerous challenges in treating injuries because of a lack of medical supplies”.\n“Israeli air strikes in Gaza are still escalating as drones and fighter jets hover in the sky,” Khoudary said.\nThe death toll has reached the same level of intensity as the earliest days of the war, said Emily Tripp, executive director of Airwars, an independent group in London that tracks recent conflicts.\nShe says preliminary data indicate the number of incidents where at least one person was killed or injured by Israeli fire hovered around 700 in April. It’s a figure comparable only to October or December 2023 – one of the heaviest periods of bombardment.\nIn the last 10 days of March, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates, an average of 100 children were killed or maimed by Israeli air strikes every day.\nAlmost 3,000 of the estimated 53,000 killed by Israel since October 7, 2023, have lost their lives since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on March 18, Gaza’s Health Ministry said.\nAmong those killed in recent days include a volunteer pharmacist with the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, who was killed with her family in a strike on Gaza City on May 4.\nA midwife from Al Awda Health and Community Association was also killed with her family in another strike on May 7.\nA journalist working for Qatar-based television network Al Araby TV, along with 11 members of his family, was also killed.",

    "Content": "Tens of thousands of people have rallied across the world in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel’s brutal war on Gaza and to mark the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by Jewish militias, remembered as the Nakba, or catastrophe.\nThe Nakbaresulted in the permanent mass displacement of Palestinians after the creation of Israel in 1948. Activists say that history is repeating itself today in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\nIn Stockholm, thousands assembled at Odenplan Square, responding to calls from various civil society organisations to protest against Israeli attacks on Gaza. Participants waved Palestinian flags, displayed photographs of children killed, and carried banners stating: “Stop the Zionist regime’s genocide in Palestine”.\nMany demonstrators bore placards listing the names of civilians killed inGaza, seeking to highlight the ongoing massacre.\nMeanwhile, in London, United Kingdom, hundreds of thousands marched towards Downing Street, demanding an end to what they described as Israel’s genocide in Gaza, 77 years on from the Nakba. Protesters, some dressed in keffiyehs and waving Palestinian flags, chanted slogans such as “Stop the genocide in Gaza”, “Free Palestine”, and “Israel is a terror state”.\nThe demonstrators denounced the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, accusing it of deliberately starving more than two million Palestinians, and criticised the UK government for its political and military backing of Israel, alleging complicity in the humanitarian crisis.\nIn Berlin, Germany, people gathered at Potsdamer Platz to protest against Israeli attacks on Gaza. Demonstrators waved Palestinian flags and held signs reading: “Your silence is complicity” and “You cannot kill us all”. Women in traditional dress carrying Nakba-themed visuals were also present.\nThe event took place amid heavy security measures, with at least three people reportedly detained.\nA solidarity march was held in Athens, Greece, where protesters, adorned in keffiyehs and carrying Palestinian flags, marched first to the embassies of the United States and Israel.\nProtests have erupted after hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the past few days as Israel intensified its attacks, with the announcement of a new ground offensive.\nGlobally, May 15 was observed as the 77th anniversary of the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes following the establishment of Israel in 1948.\nThe Israeli military has killed 53,272 Palestinians and injured 120,673 since it launched an offensive on October 7, 2023, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The Government Media Office updated the death toll to more than 61,700, noting that thousands still missing beneath the rubble are presumed dead.",

    "Content": "The Israeli military has announced the start of extensive new ground operations throughout northern and southern Gaza on a day it has killed at least 144 people in waves of relentless strikes across the Palestinian enclave.\nAt least 36 people were killed and more than 100 wounded when Israeli warplanes bombed a tent camp sheltering displaced Palestinians in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera.\nVerified videos from the scene showed many bodies, including some on fire. The dead and wounded were taken to a nearby field hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex.\nAt least 135 people were killed on Sunday morning, including 42 in the heavily bombed northern parts of Gaza, medical sources told Al Jazeera Arabic. Five journalists were also among the victims when their homes were bombed.\nAt least 464 Palestinians have been killed in the past week as the Israeli military prepared to significantly intensify its ground invasion of the Palestinian territorydespite international criticism. At least 53,339 Palestinians have been killed and 121,034 wounded since the start of the war in October 2023, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.\nThe Israeli army on Sunday confirmed the start of Operation Gideon’s Chariots, which will involve regular and reserve soldiers of the Southern Command leading the ground invasion of both northern and southern Gaza, backed by the air force.\nIt reported attacking more than 670 places in Gaza over the past week and claimed all were “Hamas targets” located both above and beneath the ground. Israel has been accused of disproportionately targeting civilians in Gaza, including displaced families.\nAmong the targets have been three major hospitals, adding to the systematic targeting of healthcare facilities across the enclave that has nowput three hospitals out of commissionthis week alone.\nThe Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza was rendered nonoperational on Sunday after the Israeli army laid siege to it beginning at dawn. Marwan al-Sultan, the director of the facility, which was the last functioning public hospital in the north, described the situation as “catastrophic” and called on international organisations topress for medical teams’ safety.\nDr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera that the bombing of the Indonesian Hospital is severely impacting chances of survival for those in need of medical care.\nThousands of sick and wounded people could die, he warned, adding that blood donations are urgently needed.\nDr Muhammad Zaqout, the director general of hospitals in Gaza, condemned “Israel’s systematic measures against hospitals”.\n“Israel deliberately kills wounded people by preventing them from reaching hospitals and directly targets patients, the wounded and medical staff inside hospitals,” he told Al Jazeera.\nHe said al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza’s Jabalia and European Gaza Hospital in southern Gaza have also been bombed, endangering patients and medical staff.\nHamas said in a statement early on Sunday that the attacks on displaced Palestinians in Khan Younis marked a “brutal crime” that was a flagrant violation of international laws and norms.\n“By granting the terrorist occupation government political and military cover, the United States administration bears direct responsibility for this insane escalation in the targeting of innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip, including children, women, and the elderly,” the Palestinian group said, also condemning the “ongoing persecution and killing” of media workers.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s expanding operation in Gaza. “I am alarmed by reported plans by Israel to expand ground operations and more,” he said on X on Saturday.\nOn Saturday, both Israel and Hamas confirmed that more mediatedtalks were under way in Qatar.\nIsrael emphasised that the talks are being held with no conditions, including the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which it has completely blocked since March 2despite looming famine.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled on Sunday that his government may be open to either a partial or a comprehensive agreement but only under strict conditions.\n“Even at this very moment, the negotiation team in Doha is working to exhaust every possibility for a deal – whether according to the Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting, which would include the release of all the hostages, the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip,” his office said in a statement, referring to White House envoy Steve Witkoff.\nHis office also slammed former Israeli negotiator Oren Setter, who resigned from the team in October and said in a February interview that Netanyahu had squandered two opportunities last year that would have released captives in exchange for ending the war.\nSetter, a retired brigadier general, criticised Netanyahu on Sunday, telling the public broadcaster Kan that he is concerned the government will once again “miss the opportunity” of a comprehensive agreement in favour of a potential partial deal.\nFar-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Sunday called on Netanyahu to pull the negotiating team back from Doha and refrain from signing any deal with Hamas. He insisted that Hamas must be completely defeated, fulfilling a war goal set out by Israel from the start.",

    "Content": "Israel and Hamas have confirmed a new round of Gaza truce talks is under way in Qatar as the Israeli military expanded its ground offensive on the besieged Palestinian territory, despite growinginternational callsfor a ceasefire.\nIsrael Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Saturday that the Hamas delegation in Doha returned to negotiations “on a hostage deal”.\nIsrael had entered the talks without any conditions, according to Katz.\nTaher al-Nono, the media adviser for the Hamas leadership, confirmed to the Reuters news agency that a new round of indirect talks had begun without any conditions.\n“The Hamas delegation outlined the position of the group and the necessity to end the war, swap prisoners, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and allowing humanitarian aid and all the needs of the people of Gaza back into the Strip,” he added.\nMedical sources told Al Jazeera that at least 70 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, as Israel launched a new offensive in Gaza.\nIsrael’s army said on social media that it was intensifying attacks and exerting “tremendous pressure” on Hamas across Gaza, and wouldn’t stop until the captives are returned and the armed group is dismantled. Katz said that Operation Gideon Chariots was being led with “great force.”\nThe new offensive comes after Israel escalated its air attacks on Gaza,killing hundreds of Palestinians in the past three days. Many of the victims were killed in northern Gaza, including in Beit Lahiya and Jabalia, which have received forced displacement orders by the Israeli army in recent days.\nAs leaders of the Arab Leagueheld a Gaza-focused summitin Iraq’s Baghdad and called for international funding to rebuild Gaza on Saturday, Hamas urged the international community to impose sanctions on Israel.\nIn a statement on its Telegram channel, the armed group described the situation in Gaza as a “full-blown genocide committed before the eyes of a world that stands helpless, while more than two and a half million people are being slaughtered in the besieged Strip”.\nThe group also reported continued fighting with invading Israeli forces, claiming on Saturday that its fighters killed and wounded two Israeli soldiers using machineguns in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City in the northern part of the enclave.\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres said he was “alarmed” by Israel’s expanded offensive in Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire.\nUN relief chief Tom Fletcher said a joint plan by the United States and Israel to replace international aid mechanisms in Gaza was a “waste of time” as more than 160,000 pallets of aid are “ready to move” at the border, but blocked by Israel.\nGermany voiced alarm over Israel’s expanded assault in Gaza, saying it was a “cause for deep concern.”\n“A large-scale military offensive also entails the risk that the catastrophic humanitarian situation for the population in Gaza and the situation of the remaining hostages will continue to deteriorate and that the prospect of an urgently needed long-term ceasefire fades,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.",

    "Content": "Tehran, Iran –Iran’s political and military leaders are pointing the finger back at Donald Trump after the United States president sharpened his rhetoric during his first major tour of the Middle East.\nIn a speech to a group of teachers gathered for a state ceremony in Tehran on Saturday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said some of Trump’s comments were not even worth responding to.\n“The level of those remarks is so low that they are a disgrace for the one who uttered them and a disgrace to the American nation,” he said, to chants of “Death to America” and others from the crowd.\nKhamenei added that Trump “lied” when he said he wants to use power towards peace, as Washington has backed “massacring” Palestinians and others across the region. He called Israel a “dangerous cancerous tumour” that must be “uprooted”.\nMeanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also told a gathering of navy officers on Saturday that Trump is extending a message of peace while threatening destruction at the same time as backing Israel’s“genocide” in the Gaza Strip.\n“Which one of this president’s words should we believe? His message of peace, or his message of massacre of human beings?” the Iranian president said, pointing out that Trump sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a move that wasinternationally criticised.\nThe statements came after Trump used his Middle East tour – during which hesigned huge dealswith Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates – to heap praise on Arab leaders neighbouring Iran and blasting the leadership in Tehran.\nThe US president told Arab leaders they were developing their infrastructure while Iran’s “landmarks are collapsing into rubble” after its theocratic establishment replaced a monarchy in a 1979 revolution.\nHe said Iran’s leaders have “managed to turn green farmland into dry deserts” as a result of corruption and mismanagement, and pointed out that Iranians are experiencing power outages several hours a day.\nThe blackouts, a result of ayears-long energy crisisthat is hurting Iran’s already strained economy, are expected to linger for the rest of this year as well, according to Iranian authorities.\nThe largest associations of the mining, steel and cement industries in Iran on Saturday wrote a joint letter to Pezeshkian, urgently requesting him to review a 90 percent electricity use restriction imposed on the critical sectors.\nTrump, who hailed Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa andlifted sanctions on Damascus, also took aim at Iran’s regional policy.\nHe described Tehran’s support for the fallen establishment of President Bashar al-Assad as a cause of “misery and death” and regional destabilisation.\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the US president’s remarks as “deceptive”, telling state media on Friday it was the US that hampered Iran through sanctions and military threats while backing Israel and attacking Syria.\nParliament chief Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who was addressing an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference in Indonesia, said Trump’s remarks showed he was “living in a delusion”.\nHossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), addressed Trump directly on Friday and said even though Iran has beautiful landmarks, “we take pride in the elevation of character, identity, culture, and Islam”.\nThe sharp rhetoric in response to Trump’s latest controversial comments come days after he teased that he may start calling the“Persian Gulf”the “Arabian Gulf” soon.\nThis angered Iranians across the board, prompting criticism of any attempt to rename the key waterway from average citizens online, authorities, local media, and even some pro-Trump Iranians outside the country who have been advocating for US sanctions and regime change.\nBoth Iran and the US say they would prefer an agreement that would serve to quickly de-escalate tensions surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme, despite the latest war of words.\nBut afterfour rounds of negotiationsmediated by Oman, any prospective deal – which would lift sanctions in exchange for making sure Iran would not have a nuclear bomb – still appears to face significant hurdles.\nTrump said Tehran has been handed a proposal torapidly advance towards a deal, but Iran’s Araghchi on Friday said no written proposal was produced yet amid “confusing and contradictory” rhetoric from Washington.\n“Mark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other NPT signatories, too,” he wrote in a post on X, in reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nKazem Gharibabadi, a senior nuclear negotiator, on Friday rejected reports by Western media outlets that Iran may agree to fully halt its enrichment of uranium for the remainder of the Trump presidency to build trust.\n“The right to enrich is our absolute red line! No halt to enrichment is acceptable.”\nTrump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear accord signed between Iran and world powers three years earlier, imposing the harshest sanctions yet by the USthat have only intensifiedduring the latest negotiations.\nThe nuclear deal set a 3.67 percent enrichment rate with first-generation centrifuges for civilian use in Iran, in exchange for lifting United Nations sanctions. Iran is now enriching up to 60 percent and has enough fissile material for multiple bombs, but has made no effort to build one yet.",

    "Content": "A group of seven European nations has called for an end to Israel’smilitary assault and blockadeof Gaza, as the United Nations aid chief says time should not be wasted on an alternative United States-backed proposal to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\nIn a joint statement late on Friday, the leaders of Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia, Spain and Norway said they “will not be silent in front of the man-made humanitarian catastrophe that is taking place before our eyes in Gaza” as Israel’s blockade has prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid for two and a half months.\n“We call upon the government of Israel to immediately reverse its current policy, refrain from further military operations and fully lift the blockade, ensuring safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian aid to be distributed throughout the Gaza strip by international humanitarian actors,” the statement read.\n“More than 50,000 men, women, and children have lost their lives. Many more could starve to death in the coming days and weeks unless immediate action is taken,” it said.\nMeanwhile, the Council of Europe, a body that works to safeguard human rights and democracy, also noted that Gaza was suffering from a“deliberate starvation”and warned that Israel was sowing “the seeds for the next Hamas” in the territory, referring to the Palestinian armed group.\n“The time for a moral reckoning over the treatment of Palestinians has come – and it is long overdue,” said Dora Bakoyannis, rapporteur for the Middle East at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\nThe European calls came hours after UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said 160,000 pallets of relief and 9,000 trucks were ready to enter Gaza.\n“To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let’s not waste time. We already have a plan,” he said in a statement.\n“We have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself – 160,000 pallets of it – ready to move. Now,” he said.\n“We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.”\nIsrael has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have warned of shrinking food, fuel and medicine supplies to the territory of 2.4 million Palestinians facing acute starvation.\nEarlier, the US and Israel said they were preparing a plan that would allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas’s hands.\nUnder the heavily criticised alternative aid plan, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aims to start work in Gaza by the end of May.\nIt intends to work with private US security and logistics firms to transport aid into Gaza to so-called secure hubs where it will then be distributed by aid groups, a source familiar with the plan told the Reuters news agency. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded.\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also asked Israel to allow humanitarian deliveries by the UN and aid groups to resume now until its infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to “alleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure”.\nThe UN, however, said it would not work with the foundation because the distribution plan is not impartial, neutral or independent. Israel says the blockade, alongside “military pressure”, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives.\nOn Thursday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated the group’s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any truce talks with Israel.\n“Access to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right – not a subject for negotiation,” he said.",

    "Content": "Arab leaders have urged the international community to fund their plan torebuild the Gaza Stripafter United States President Donald Trump reiterated a proposal to take over the Palestinian territory.\nAn Arab League summit held on Saturday in Baghdad said in its final statement that it urged “countries and international and regional financial institutions to provide prompt financial support” to back its Gaza reconstruction plan.\n“This genocide [in Gaza] has reached a level of ugliness unparalleled in all conflicts in history,” Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in his opening speech at the 34th Arab Summit, which was dominated byIsrael’s genocide in Gaza.\nHe said Iraq backed the creation of an “Arab fund to support reconstruction efforts”, adding that Iraq will contribute $20m towards the fund and another $20m for Lebanon, which has also been in conflict with Israel.\nThe Iraqi prime minister said Baghdad rejects “the forced displacement of Palestinians”, calling for an end to “the massacres in Gaza, the attacks on the West Bank and the occupied territories”.\n“We have called, and continue to call, for serious and responsible Arab action to save Gaza and reactivate the UNRWA,” he said, referring to the UN body for Palestinian aid.\nSaturday’s talks in the Iraqi capital came only a day after Trump completed hisMiddle East tour, triggering hopes of a ceasefire and the renewal of aid delivery to Gaza.\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez – who have sharply criticisedIsrael’s genocidein Gaza – were guests at the summit.\n“We need a permanent ceasefire now, the unconditional release of the hostages now, and the free flow of humanitarian aid ending the blockade now,” Guterres said.\nSpain’s Sanchez said the humanitarian crisis in Gaza must end “immediately and without delay”.\n“Palestine and Spain are working on a new draft to be presented to the United Nations, where we are demanding Israel to end the unjust humanitarian siege laid to Gaza and to allow for the unconditional delivery of relief aid into Gaza”, he said.\nHe also said there must be “more pressure on Israel to end the carnage unfolding in Gaza by all the conceivable means, namely the tools available under the international law.”\n“And here, I would like to announce that Spain will present a proposal to the General Assembly for the International Criminal Court to examine Israel’s compliance with the delivery of relief aid into Gaza,” the Spanish prime minister added.\nIn March, Israel ended a ceasefire reached with Hamas in January, renewing deadly attacks across Gaza and forcing a blockade of food and other essential items. In recent days, Israel has intensified its offensive, as tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to starve.\nAt a preparatory meeting of the Arab League summit, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said they will try to endorse decisions that were made at their meeting in Cairo in March to support Gaza’s reconstruction as an alternative to Trump’swidely condemned proposalto take over the enclave.\nDuring his visit to Qatar, Trump on Thursday reiterated that he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”. Earlier this year, he caused an uproar by declaring that the US would turn Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, prompting Arab leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild the territory, at a summit in Cairo.\nThe Arab plan for Gaza proposes rebuilding the Palestinian enclave without displacing its 2.4 million residents.\nBesides Gaza, Arab officials also discussed Syria, which only six months ago entered a new chapter in its history after the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.\nEarlier this week, Trump in Riyadh met Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose group spearheaded the offensive that toppled al-Assad last December. Prior to their meeting, he also announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted in a huge boost to the government in Damascus.\nAl-Sharaa, who was imprisoned for years in Iraq on charges of belonging to al-Qaeda following the 2003 US-led invasion, however, missed Baghdad’s summit after several powerful Iraqi politicians voiced opposition to his visit. The Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani represented Damascus instead.\nSaturday’s summit also came amid Iran’s ongoing nuclear talks with the US. Trump has pursued diplomacy with Iran as he seeks to stave off a threatened military strike by Israel on Iran, a desire shared by many of the region’s leaders.\nOn Thursday, Trump said a deal was “getting close”, but by Friday, he was warning that “something bad is going to happen” if the Iranians do not move fast.\nIraq has only recently regained a semblance of normalcy after decades of devastating conflict and turmoil, and its leaders view the summit as an opportunity to project an image of stability.\nReporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the summit was “very crucial” for Iraq.\n“This is the first time the summit has been held in Iraq since 2012 and Iraq takes it as a credit to regain its rule as a player to bridge the gap between member states of the Arab League,” he said.",

    "Content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that a new offensive in the besieged Gaza Strip will be an intensive military operation aimed at defeating Hamas, but stopped short of detailing just how much of the enclave’s territory would be seized.\nIn a Hebrew-language video message on X, addressing the Security Cabinet-approved plan to expand the Gaza offensive, Netanyahu said on Monday that Gaza’s Palestinian population “will be moved, for its own protection”.\nEighteen months of Israeli attacks have killed more than 52,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including thousands of children, and wounded nearly 120,000 others.\nNetanyahu also said Israeli soldiers would not go into Gaza, launch raids and then retreat. “The intention is the opposite of that,” he said.\nHis remarks come as Israel’s political and military leaders approved plans toexpand the Gaza offensiveand take over aid deliveries to the devastated and starving enclave.\nNetanyahu’s cabinet unanimously approved plans to call up reservists and put the Israeli military in charge of food and other vital supplies to the 2.3 million people suffering under its blockade of the Palestinian territory.\nNewswires reported unnamed Israeli officials suggesting that the plans include the “conquest” and full military occupation of the entire Gaza Strip.\nThe expanded offensive “could go as far as seizing the entire enclave”, the Reuters news agency reported.\n“The plan will include, among other things, the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories, moving the Gaza population south for their protection,” a source told the AFP news agency.\nThe source added that Netanyahu “continues to promote” United States President Donald Trump’s plan for thedeparture of Palestiniansfrom the enclave.\nSenior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi told Al Jazeera the group would only accept a deal with Israel that includes a comprehensive ceasefire and the complete withdrawal from Gaza.\n“Our people have no choice but to achieve a comprehensive deal that guarantees security and safety for our people,” he said, adding that any Israeli efforts to achieve concessions through threats or mass killings would fail.\nA United Nations spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “alarmed” by the Israeli plan that “will inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza”.\n“Gaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state,” said spokesman Farhan Haq.\nThe plans have stirred significant tension inside Israel as well.\nWhile Netanyahu again asserted that the goal was to “defeat” Hamas and bring back several dozen captives held in Gaza, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli campaign group, said in a statement on Monday that the plan is “sacrificing” those still held in the Palestinian territory.\nHeated disagreements also reportedly erupted during the cabinet meeting between the political and military figures.\nArmy chief Eyal Zamir reportedly warned that Israel could “lose” the captives in Gaza if it pushed ahead with a full-blown military offensive.\nFar-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said that, as Israel has done in the past two months, it should continue toblock all food, water, medicine, fuel and other aid from entering Gaza to starve the population.\nHe also advocated for “bombing food warehouses and generators” so there are no more supplies and electricity is fully cut off.\nBut Zamir warned this would “endanger” Israel as it would expose the country to even more allegations ofviolations of international law.\n“You don’t understand what you are saying. You are endangering us all. There is an international law, we are committed to it. We cannot starve the Strip, your statements are dangerous,” Zamir said, according to Israel’s national broadcaster, Kan.\nIn an interview with Israeli Army Radio, opposition leader Yair Lapid questioned Netanyahu’s decision to mobilise tens of thousands of reservists, saying the prime minister was calling up troops and extending their service without setting a goal for the operation.\nAnother opposition figure, Yair Golan, said Netanyahu was only trying to save his government from collapsing as the plan “serves no security purpose and does not bring the release of the hostages closer”.\nBen-Gvir was reportedly the only member of the Security Cabinet who opposed the plan for Israel to bypass existing aid routes by international organisations.\nIsrael, which has blocked the entrance of all supplies into Gaza since March 2, reportedly plans to use US security contractors to control the flow of aid into Gaza.\nHowever, the plan is not expected to come into effect immediately, as Israeli officials believe there is enough food in Gaza for now, even asPalestinians are starving to death.\nThe Israeli plans also envisage the establishment of a new “humanitarian zone” in southern Gaza that would work as a base for aid.\nThe Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes United Nations agencies, said on Sunday that Israeli officials were seeking its consent to deliver aid through what it described as “Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings”.\nIn a statement, the HCT said such a plan would be dangerous and would “contravene fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic – as part of a military strategy”.\nThe coalition said the UN would not participate in this scheme as it does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.\nJan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told Al Jazeera the Israeli government wanted to “militarise, manipulate, politicise the aid by allowing only aid to a few concentration hubs in the south, a scheme where people will be screened where it’s a completely inoperable system”.\n“That would force people to move to get aid, and it would continue the starvation of the civilian population,” he added.\nOn Monday, Hamas branded Israel’s plans to take over aid provision “political blackmail”.\n“We reject the use of aid as a tool of political blackmail and support the UN’s stance against any arrangements that violate humanitarian principles,” the armed group said in a statement, insisting that Israel is “fully responsible” for the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza.",
