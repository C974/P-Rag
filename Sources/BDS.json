  "BDS_Movement": {
    "Description": "The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the largest coalition in Palestinian society that is leading the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, strongly believes that ending the complicity of states, corporations and institutions in Israel's ongoing, livestreamed genocide against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza is the most effective form of solidarity with the Palestinian struggle to end the genocide and dismantle Israel's 76-year-old regime of settler-colonialism and apartheid.",
    "Corporate_Complicity": {
      "General": "Corporations that are implicated in the commission of international crimes connected to Israel's unlawful occupation, racial segregation and apartheid regime - within or beyond the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 - are all complicit and must be held accountable. The BDS movement's Corporate Complicity Criteria are here. Direct complicity includes military, logistical, intelligence, financial and infrastructure support. The corporations, as well as their boards of directors and executives, may face criminal liability for this complicity.",
      "Legal_Expert_Opinion": "According to a legal expert opinion commissioned by Al Haq and SOMO, 'A corporation or individual businessperson who knowingly assists a State in violating customary international law, including the prohibition of committing genocide, may be complicit in such a violation.' This is particularly true in light of the International Court of Justice's determination that Israel is plausibly perpetrating genocide in Gaza, as well as its July 19 legally-binding Advisory Opinion affirming Israel's illegal occupation and apartheid system."
    },
    "Legal_Context": {
      "International_Criminal_Court": "On 21 November 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) finally issued its long overdue arrest warrants against sitting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former war cabinet minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in Gaza.",
      "International_Court_of_Justice": "In July 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel's entire occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is illegal and violates the prohibition against apartheid."

    "Boycott_Strategy": {
      "Targeted_vs_NonTargeted": "People of conscience around the world are rightfully shattered, enraged, and sometimes feeling powerless about Israel's #GazaGenocide, armed, funded and shielded from accountability by the colonial West, led by the US. Many feel compelled to boycott all products and services of companies tied in any way to Israel. The question is how to make boycotts most effective and impactful in holding corporations accountable for their complicity in the suffering of Palestinians. The BDS movement uses the historically successful method of targeted boycotts inspired by the South African anti-apartheid movement, the US Civil Rights movement, the Indian and the Irish anti-colonial struggles, among others worldwide. We must strategically focus on a relatively smaller number of carefully selected companies and products for maximum impact. We need to target companies that play a clear and direct role in Israel's crimes against Palestinians, as well as in violating the rights of other peoples/communities, and where there is real potential for winning.",
      "Success_Examples": "This is how the BDS movement has successfully forced companies like G4S, Veolia, Orange, Puma, and Pillsbury, among others, to end their complicity in Israel's grave human rights violations and crimes.",
      "Impact_of_Boycotts": "Compelling large complicit companies, through strategic and context-sensitive boycott and divestment campaigns as well as well-thought-out shareholder strategies, to end their complicity in Israeli apartheid and war crimes against Palestinians sends a very powerful message to hundreds of other complicit companies that 'your time will come, so get out before it's too late!'",
      "Economic_Context": "The fact that Israel's economy has been in steady, at times drastic, decline also helps in showing that business with Israel is not only unethical and illegal, but also financially irresponsible. Israel is quickly turning into what the BDS movement calls a #ShutDownNation, with the dramatic flight of capital, severe brain drain, drying foreign direct investments in high tech, and a generally unsafe, unstable, and 'collapsing' economy. Ethics and international law aside, this should help us mobilize most shareholders to oppose any investment in Israel.",
      "Intersectionality": "As an intersectional movement that connects Palestinian liberation with racial, indigenous, social, gender and climate justice struggles, we also recommend prioritizing the boycott of companies that are targets of mobilizations in other struggles of the oppressed. We recommend, where applicable, adopting an ethical investment policy or a universal human rights-based investment screen, to prevent investments in all companies complicit in human rights violations anywhere."

    ],
    "Israeli_Companies_and_Banks": {
      "Complicity_Criteria": "The BDS movement targets complicity, not identity. When it comes to Israeli companies, being non-complicit entails: (a) Not being implicated in Israel's military occupation, apartheid or settler-colonialism; and (b) Publicly recognizing Palestinian rights under international law, primarily the right of refugees to return in accordance with UN resolution 194. As far as we know, there is no Israeli company that meets these two conditions. Accordingly, the BDS movement has called for boycotting and divesting from all Israeli companies, unless they meet the above two conditions."
    },
    "Divestment_and_Exclusion": {
      "Description": "In addition to boycott and pressure targets, divestment and exclusion targets (covered in a separate document) are indispensable in the BDS movement's tools against complicit corporations. The BDS movement works to pressure governments, city councils, investment funds, institutions (including universities), trade unions, etc. to exclude from procurement contracts and investments as well as to divest from, as the case may be, as many complicit companies as practical, especially arms companies, tech companies, and financial institutions.",

        "Reason": "US fossil fuel multinational Chevron is the main corporation extracting gas claimed by apartheid Israel in the East Mediterranean. Chevron generates billions in revenues, strengthening Israel's war chest and apartheid system, exacerbating the climate crisis and Gaza siege, and is complicit in depriving the Palestinian people of their right to sovereignty over their natural resources. Chevron has thousands of retail gas stations around the world under the Chevron, Caltex, and Texaco brand names. Groups around the world have joined the campaign to #BoycottChevron.

        "Brand": "Intel",
        "Reason": "In December 2023, amidst Israel's genocide in Gaza, Intel announced that it will invest $25 billion in apartheid Israel. In June 2024, following prolonged BDS pressure, and in response mainly to the financial risk of investing in a #ShutDownNation, the tech giant dropped the project, according to Israeli financial media sources. For decades, Intel has been the largest international investor in apartheid Israel. Its plant at 'Kiryat Gat' is built on land within the boundaries of the Palestinian village of Iraq al Manshiya, which was ethnically cleansed, razed to the ground, and then replaced by the current Israeli settlement. Intel remains deeply complicit in feeding Israel's genocidal war chest, so the #BoycottIntel campaign continues."

        "Reason": "Dell Technologies supplies the servers, maintains services and related equipment to the Israeli military as a part of a $150 million 2023 contract funded by US foreign aid. Dell is committed to Israel's ongoing ethnic cleansing of indigenous Palestinians by establishing research and development activity in Israel's National Cyber Park that attempts to strengthen illegal settlements in the Naqab, displacing Palestinian Bedouin communities. One month into Israel's Gaza genocide, founder and CEO Michael Dell donated $350 million worth of shares to Israel, further solidifying the genocidal partnership between Israel and Dell Technologies."

Through its partnerships with the Israeli government, military, prisons and police, HP provides critical technological and logistical support that facilitates war crimes and crimes against humanity, including illegal settlement construction and apartheid in the OPT. HPE supports Israel's Population and Immigration Authority, a crucial pillar of its apartheid system, by providing technology for its databases and IT systems. HP Inc (US) provides services to the offices of genocide leaders, Israeli PM Netanyahu and Financial Minister Smotrich."

        "Brand": "Carrefour",
        "Reason": "The France-based multinational retailer is involved in war crimes committed by the Israeli regime of settler-colonialism and apartheid over the Palestinian people. It started with the French group announcing a franchise partnership with Electra Consumer Products (ECP) and its retail subsidiary, Yenot Bitan, both active in the illegal Israeli settlement enterprise. During Israel's genocidal assault against Palestinians in Gaza, Carrefour-Israel has supported Israeli soldiers partaking in the unfolding genocide of Palestinians in Gaza with gifts of personal packages. Evidence also shows that there is at least one Carrefour-branded branch in an illegal settlement in the OPT. Electra Retail Ltd., a subsidiary of Electra Consumer Products, has a partnership with Israeli bank Hapoalim, which is listed in the UN database for complicity in Israel's illegal settlement enterprise. Carrefour has also received loans from four major complicit Israeli banks, and it has established a partnership with six complicit high-tech Israeli start-ups on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, among others."

Both companies' weapons have been directly linked to Israeli attacks on Palestinians in Gaza, including mass killings, such as the bombing of the Tel al-Sultan refugee camp in Rafah on 26 May, and the 10 September bombing of Palestinians sheltering in al-Mawasi, which Israel had designated as a 'safe zone.'"

Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World and Disney's Snow White star actors Shira Haas and Gal Gadot, respectively, that have consciously and irrefutably taken up roles as cultural ambassadors for Israel, directly representing genocidal Israel's propaganda efforts. For Captain America, Marvel and Disney are reviving the racist character of Ruth Bat-Seraph, whose decades-old backstory includes working for Mossad. Disney+ is therefore clearly implicated in enabling Israel's genocide by dehumanizing Palestinians."

In April 2024, months after the ICJ ruled Israel is plausibly committing genocide in Gaza, Google signed a new contract with the IDF, allowing military units to access Google's automation technologies, data and AI services.
